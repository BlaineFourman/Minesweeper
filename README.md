# Minesweeper
Classic minesweeper game using p5.js 

When playing, make sure to run code on a server to allow the text to load. 
After completing a game refresh the page to create a new game. Each game bombs are based on a probability so the bomb count can vary
slightly. 

Left click to open that square. If that square has a bomb then the game is over and all bombs will be displayed in red. 
If a number is shown then there are that many bombs adjacent to that box. Right click to place a flag on the current box. 
If all flags are used on bombs then you have won the game. A pop up will appear to let you know if you have one. If after all flags have
been placed and the game continues to run, then you have not placed the all of the flags correctly.
